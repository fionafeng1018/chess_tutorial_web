			<h1>Introduction of “Go”</h1>
			<p>Go is probably the oldest board games in the world. It is mostly popular in East Asia but has now gained some popularity in the rest of the world.</p>
			<p>Go is a board game playing by two players, one of the players holds the white stones, another the black. They play the stones in turn on a board, which is marked out in a grid pattern of vertical and horizontal lines. Stones can only place on the intersections but not the squares, the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent.</p>
			<p>The standard board is a 19*19 square with 361 intersections, nine intersecting points are dotted which are called stars, four on the corner, four on the side and one central star.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of the game, the elder player need to hold some white stones in his/her hand, the other player can choose to place whether one or two black stones on the board which also represents odd or even for guessing the stones in the elder’s hand, the right one will hold the black stone to get the opportunity of the first move and vice versa.</p>
			<p>When the game comes to the end, both sides need to confirm that there will be no more placing. The referee responsible for taking out the dead stones from the board. The following stage is to count the stones of the one side, the people who holds the black stone need to have 185 stones to win the game and vice versa. The people who holds the white stones need to have 177 stones to win the game and vice versa.</p>
